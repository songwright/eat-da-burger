# Eat-Da-Burger

This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, it appears on the side, waiting to be devoured. I made this for my full stack boot camp at the UCLA Extension school. It uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.
